# Traffic-Prediction
This Python script performs various tasks related to time series analysis, data exploration, feature engineering, data visualization, data transformation, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

Imports the necessary libraries:

NumPy for numerical operations

Pandas for data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Datetime for working with dates and times

TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the model

Statsmodels for time series analysis

Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and evaluation

Loads a dataset from a CSV file named "traffic.csv" into a Pandas DataFrame.

Performs data exploration by displaying the head of the dataset and providing information about the DataFrame's columns and data types.

Copies the dataset into another DataFrame for further exploration.

Visualizes the time series data by plotting the traffic trend at different junctions over the years.

Performs feature engineering by extracting additional features from the DateTime column, such as year, month, date number, hour, and day of the week.

Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) by creating several plots to examine the traffic trends at junctions based on different factors like month, date, hour, and day of the week.

Transforms and preprocesses the data for time series analysis by pivoting the DataFrame and normalizing the values using Min-Max scaling. It also applies differencing to remove seasonality.

Splits the data into training and test sets.

Defines a function to create sequences and labels for the training set.

Sets the sequence length and creates training and testing sequences using the defined function.

Defines the architecture of the LSTM model using the Keras Sequential API. The model consists of LSTM, Dense, and output layers.

Compiles the model by specifying the optimizer and loss function.

Defines early stopping as a callback to prevent overfitting during training.

Trains the model on the training data and validates it on the test data using the fit() function. The training process is monitored, and early stopping is applied.

Makes predictions on the test data using the trained model.

Transforms the predicted and actual values back to the original scale using the Min-Max scaler.

Calculates the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the predicted and actual values.

Prints the calculated RMSE as the evaluation result.
